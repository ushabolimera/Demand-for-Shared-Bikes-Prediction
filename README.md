# Conclusion

*   From the Exploratory Data Analysis we can observe that demand for the shared bikes is high in summer and very low in winter.
*   The demand for the shared bikes is high in 2019 compared to 2018.
*   We can observe the positive correlation between registered,casual,instant with cnt.
*   The demand is high in september month and low in january.
*   The demand for the shared bikes is high in saturday and low in tuesday.
*   Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Models shows Good Adjusted R2 score of 99.67% and 99.10% respectively.
*   The Important Features from the Random Forest are Registered, Casual, Instant.
*   The variables that are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes are Registered, Casual, Instant.
